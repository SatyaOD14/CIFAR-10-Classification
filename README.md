# CIFAR-10-Classification
This diagram illustrates the working of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The process begins with an input image, followed by convolution layers that extract features, pooling layers that reduce dimensionality, and finally fully connected layers that classify the image into categories such as CIFAR-10 classes.
